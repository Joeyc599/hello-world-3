Hello, everyone!
My name is Joseph A Chargin, V, but please, call me Joe. I'm twenty years old and I attend California State University, Monterey Bay as a Molecular Biology Major. I'm interested in becoming a geneticist and bioinformatician. I work at Gilroy Gardens as a Rides Team Lead and I also tutor my best friends' younger brother Nicholas. I'm very busy!
